Hi there, I'm Mradul ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second-year Computer Science student at IIT Bombay, passionate about creating impactful software solutions. With a solid foundation in web development, particularly in React and Flutter, I've built projects ranging from dynamic user interfaces to customized software tools. Currently, I'm diving deeper into AI, exploring the fascinating world of speech-to-text models using TensorFlow.

When I'm not coding, you might find me refining my mental calculation skills, tweaking my Conky configuration, or experimenting with new tech stacks. I'm always on the lookout for exciting projects and collaborations, so feel free to reach out!
